P6.8 Compute the alternating sum of all elements in a list. 
For example, if your program reads the input
1 4 9 16 9 7 4 9 11
then it computes
1 - 4 + 9 - 16 + 9 - 7 + 4 - 9 + 11 = -2

P6.11 Write a function def equals(a, b) that checks whether 
two lists have the same elements in the same order.

P6.12 Write a function def sameSet(a, b) that checks whether two 
lists have the same elements in some order, ignoring duplicates. 
For example, the two lists

1 4 9 16 9 7 4 9 11
and
11 11 7 9 16 4 1

would be considered identical. You will probably need one or more 
helper functions.
